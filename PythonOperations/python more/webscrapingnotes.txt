web scraping

- Web Scraping is the technique used by programmers to automate the process of
 finding and extracting data from the internet within a relatively short time.
- using Python, Requests, and BeautifulSoup to scrap some pages
- To scrap and extract any information from the internet, youâ€™ll probably need to go through three stages: 
  Fetching HTML, Obtaining HTML Tree, then Extracting information from the tree.
  (HTML tree is a representation of the different levels of the HTML code, it shows the hierarchy of the code.)
- We will use the Requests library to fetch the HTML code from a specific URL. Then, we will use BeautifulSoup to Parse and Extract the HTML tree, and finally,
  we will use pure Python to organize the data.

Basic Scraping ::
step 1 : Install BeautifulSoup - pip install bs4
step 2 : from bs4 import BeautifulSoup as bs
         import requests as rq
step3 : url = 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_coffee_production' //fetching main url to html code
	#Extract HTMl tree
	page = rq.get(url).text 
	soup = bs(page) //feed html to beautifulsoup
